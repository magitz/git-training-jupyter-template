# UF Research Computing git and gitbub.com training

This training will start with some slides which are part of the source repository at: <https://ufresearchcomputing.github.io/git-training/#/>

After going over the slides, we'll come back to this.

## Resources

There are many great git and github.com tutorials out there. Here are some that I particularly like and have relied on in developing this training.

Source | Notes
-------|------
[Software Carpentry Version Control with Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) | This is a popular module in the Software Carpentry curriculum. It is designed to be a 3-hour instructor-lead training module but can be worked through on your own as well.
[GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/) | This site has many lessons that use github.com and automation to walk users through hands-on exercises to learn aspects of git and github.com using the tools.
[try.github.io](https://try.github.io/) | More github tutorials
[education.github.com](https://education.github.com/)| Information on educational discounts--plans change regularly, check for current benefits.
[classroom.github.com](https://classroom.github.com/)| For instructors wanting to use git in the classroom. Manages individual and group assignments, great tool for the classroom! Also, stickers!
[pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/)| Information on using github.com to host web sites.
[bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org/product)| Github is not the only host of git repositories. Bitbucket is another popular host.
